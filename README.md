## What's This?

My little slice of the internet, built with modern tech and way too much coffee. This portfolio and blog is where I share my tech adventures, coding exploits, and occasional wisdom about avoiding burnout (something I learned the hard way).

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Astro 5.x (SSR) - because sometimes you just want things to be fast without the client-side drama
- **UI Components**: Svelte 5.x - for when things need to get interactive
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 - because writing actual CSS in 2026 is for masochists
- **Content**: Markdown with auto-linking headings - keeping it simple and semantic
- **Deployment**: Vercel - where websites go to live their best lives

## Running Locally

Assuming you have pnpm installed and enough coffee in your system:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/chris-nowicki/chrisnowicki.dev.git

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview the production build
pnpm preview

# Run tests (if you're into that sort of thing)
pnpm test
```
