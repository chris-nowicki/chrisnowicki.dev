I'm writing this from my home office, our new puppy Theo zooming around like a maniac in the background. It's been almost two years since I wrote about [burnout and breaking into tech](breaking-into-tech-and-burnout), and yeah yeah, I probably should've posted an update sooner. But here we are.

> Spoiler: I'm still in tech, still occasionally burned out, and I've switched jobs twice. Let's get into it.

## Let's Talk About Jobs

Who would have thought breaking into tech would lead to switching jobs twice in the same year!? Like, **what!?**

I'm not going to get into all the details, but here's the honest version: I was genuinely happy at This Dot Labs. Great team, interesting work, and definitely wasn't looking to leave. But then Commerce reached out with an opportunity that checked boxes I didn't even know I had. More hands-on coding and a chance to get into Developer Experience work.

Making that decision was harder than I expected. Leaving a good thing for something potentially better is scary. But I took the leap, and so far? No regrets.

> The lesson here: sometimes opportunities find you when you're not looking. Stay open.

## Burnout (Again, But Different)

A few years ago, I was burned out from the endless apply-reject-repeat cycle. This time? It was different.

I pulled back from posting on social media. Obviously, no blog posts happened. I wasn't showing up in the tech community like I used to. But here's the thing: I gave myself permission to do that.

After fighting so hard to break into tech, I needed to actually *be* in tech. To focus on my new roles, learn the ropes, and not feel guilty about going quiet. That break wasn't failure; it was necessary.

But now I'm back. Rested-ish. Ready to write, post, and reconnect with the community that helped me get here.

## The Future

I'm beyond stoked for what's to come in 2026. I'm ready to get back to writing more technical posts, and would love to make a video or two. I want to dive more into my creative side along with software development. So I'm stoked to explore all of that!

**Goals for 2026:**

- Write more blog posts
- Start a monthly newsletter
- Make a video or two and post to YouTube
- Speak at more conferences
- Go to at least one conference
- Build more side projects
- Learn as much as I can about AI, LLMs, and the craziness that is happening in the tech world

## Final Thoughts

If you're in that quiet season right now — the one where you're not posting, not building side projects, maybe just surviving — that's okay. Sometimes progress looks like showing up to your job and doing your best. That counts.

Catch you in the next post.
